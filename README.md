Obsolete
========

It looks like [ribol](https://github.com/zcaudate/ribol) already does everything
I was hoping for with this library. At least for its initial incarnation.

I (along with pretty much every other clojure newb on the planet, it seems)
still have some vague hopes of growing this into something that resembles
a full-fledged debugger. But that's a much more ambitious task, and I'll
almost definitely be building from there instead of what's here currently.

As such, this should almost definitely just be considered nothing more than a
pointless and silly historical oddity.

OTOH, it was a learning experience, so I can't call it a waste of time. I'm
just glad no one else bothered looking into it.

Common Lisp-ish exception handling for clojure

TODO
====

mrdrogalis has some excellent libraries which are along
these same lines.

https://github.com/MichaelDrogalis/dire is all about separating
the concerns of the functions that handle errors and the
functions that associate the error-handlers with the
actual errors.

https://github.com/MichaelDrogalis/night-vision is, apparently,
also quite awesome.

Arguably, at least, this should either be part of those or
built on them. Depending on which really higher level.
