Common Lisp-ish exception handling for clojure

TODO
====

mrdrogalis has some excellent libraries which are along
these same lines.

https://github.com/MichaelDrogalis/dire is all about separating
the concerns of the functions that handle errors and the
functions that associate the error-handlers with the
actual errors.

https://github.com/MichaelDrogalis/night-vision is, apparently,
also quite awesome.

Arguably, at least, this should either be part of those or
built on them. Depending on which really higher level.
